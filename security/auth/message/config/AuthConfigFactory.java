/**
 * This class is used to obtain <code>AuthConfigProvider</code> objects 
 * that can be used to obtain authentication context configuration objects,
 * that is, <code>ClientAuthConfig</code> and <code>ServerAuthConfig</code>
 * objects.
 * <p>Authentication context configuration objects are used to obtain
 * authentication context objects. Authentication context objects,
 * that is, <code>ClientAuthContext</code> and <code>ServerAuthContex</code>
 * objects, encapsulate authentication modules. Authentication modules are 
 * pluggable components that perform security-related processing of
 * request and response messages.
 *
 * <p> Callers do not operate on modules directly.
 * Instead they rely on an authentication context to manage the 
 * invocation of modules.  A caller obtains an authentication context
 * by calling the <code>getAuthContext</code> method on a 
 * <code>ClientAuthConfig</code> or <code>ServerAuthConfig</code> 
 * obtained from an AuthConfigProvider.
 *
 * <p> The following represents a typical sequence of calls for obtaining
 * a client authentication context, and then using it to secure 
 * a request.
 * <ol>
 * <li>AuthConfigFactory factory = AuthConfigFactory.getFactory();
 * <li>AuthConfigProvider provider = factory.getConfigProvider(layer,appID,listener);
 * <li>ClientAuthConfig config = provider.getClientAuthConfig(layer,appID,cbh)
 * <li>String authContextID = config.getAuthContextID(messageInfo);
 * <li>ClientAuthContext context = config.getAuthContext(authContextID,subject,properties);
 * <li>context.secureRequest(messageInfo,subject);
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p> A system-wide AuthConfigFactory implementation can be set by invoking
 * <code>setFactory</code>, and retrieved using <code>getFactory</code>.
 *
 * <p> Every implementation of this abstract class must offer a public,
 * zero argument constructor. This constructor must support the construction
 * and registration (including self-registration) of AuthConfigProviders 
 * from a persistent declarative representation.
 * For example, a factory implementation class could interpret the contents
 * of a file containing a sequence of configuration entries, with one entry per
 * AuthConfigProvider, and with each entry representing:
 * <ul>
 * <li> The fully qualified name of the provider implementation class (or null)
 * <li> The list of provider initialization properties (which could be empty)
 * </ul>
 * Any provider initialization properties must be specified in a 
 * form that can be passed to the provider constructor within a Map of key, 
 * value pairs, and where all keys and values within the Map are of type 
 * String.
 * <p>
 * The entry syntax must also provide for the optional inclusion of information
 * sufficient to define a RegistrationContext. This information would only 
 * be present when the factory will register the provider. 
 * For example, each entry could provide for the inclusion of one or more
 * RegistrationContext objects of the following form: 
 * <ul>
 * <li> The message layer name (or null)
 * <li> The application context identifier (or null)
 * <li> The registration description (or null)
 * </ul>
 * When a RegistrationContext is not included, the factory must make it 
 * convenient for the provider to self-register with the factory during 
 * the provider construction (see 
 * <code>registerConfigProvider(AuthConfigProvider provider, ...)</code>).
 * <P> An AuthConfigFactory implementation is free to choose is own 
 * persistent declarative syntax as long as it conforms to the requirements 
 * defined by this class.
