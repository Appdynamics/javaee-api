/**
 * The methods of this interface are used by containers to
 * create policy statements in a Policy provider.
 * An object that implements the PolicyConfiguration interface provides the
 * policy statement configuration interface for a corresponding policy context
 * within the corresponding Policy provider.
 * <P>
 * The life cycle of a policy context
 * is defined by three states; "open", "inService", and "deleted". A policy
 * context is in one of these three states.
 * <P>
 * A policy context in the "open" state is in the process of being 
 * configured, and may be operated on by any of the methods of the 
 * PolicyConfiguration interface. A policy context in the "open" state
 * must not be assimilated at <code>Policy.refresh</code> into the policy
 * statements used by the Policy provider in performing its access decisions.
 * In order for the policy statements of a policy context to be assimilated
 * by the associated provider, the policy context must be in the
 * "inService" state. A policy context in the "open" state is transitioned to
 * the "inService" state by calling the commit method.
 * <P>
 * A policy context in the "inService" state is available for assimilation
 * into the policy statements being used to perform access decisions by the
 * associated Policy provider. Providers assimilate policy contexts containing
 * policy statements when the refresh method of the provider is called. When
 * a provider's refresh method is called, it must assimilate only those policy
 * contexts whose state is "inService" and it must ensure that the policy
 * statements put into service for each policy context are only those defined
 * in the context at the time of the call to refresh. A policy context in the
 * "inService" state is not available for additional configuration and may be
 * returned to the "open" state by calling the getPolicyConfiguration method
 * of the PolicyConfigurationFactory.
 * <P>
 * A policy context in the "deleted" state is neither available for
 * configuration, nor is it available for assimilation into the Provider. A
 * policy context whose state is "deleted" may be reclaimed for subsequent
 * processing by calling the getPolicyConfiguration method of the associated 
 * PolicyConfigurationFactory. A "deleted" policy context
 * is transitioned to the "open" state when it it returned as a result of
 * a call to getPolicyConfiguration.
 * <P>
 * The following table captures the correspondence between the policy context
 * life cycle and the methods of the PolicyConfiguration interface.
 * The rightmost 3 columns of the table correspond to the 
 * PolicyConfiguration state identified at the head of the column.
 * The values in the cells of these columns indicate
 * the next state resulting from a call to the method 
 * identifed in the leftmost column of the corresponding row, or that
 * calling the method is unsupported in the state 
 * represented by the column (in which case the state will remain unchanged).
