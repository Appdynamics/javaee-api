/**

 * The container fires an event of this type for each Java class or interface added by
 * {@link BeforeBeanDiscovery#addAnnotatedType(AnnotatedType)}.
 * </p>

 * Any observer of this event is permitted to wrap and/or replace the {@link javax.enterprise.inject.spi.AnnotatedType}. The
 * container must use the final value of this property, after all observers have been called, to discover the types and read the
 * annotations of the program elements.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * For example, the following observer decorates the {@link javax.enterprise.inject.spi.AnnotatedType} for every class that is
 * added by {@link BeforeBeanDiscovery#addAnnotatedType(AnnotatedType)}.

 * <p>
 * If any observer method of a {@code ProcessSyntheticAnnotatedType} event throws an exception, the exception is treated as a
 * definition error by the container.
