 * <p>This interface allows tag handlers implementing it to receive

 *
 * <p>This interface is implemented by both &lt;sql:query&gt; and
 * &lt;sql:update&gt;. Its <code>addSQLParameter()</code> method
 * is called by nested parameter actions (such as &lt;sql:param&gt;)
 * to substitute <code>PreparedStatement</code> parameter values for
 * "?" parameter markers in the SQL statement of the enclosing
 * <code>SQLExecutionTag</code> action.</p>
 *
 * <p>The given parameter values are converted to their corresponding
 * SQL type (following the rules in the JDBC specification) before
 * they are sent to the database.</p>
 *
 * <p>Keeping track of the index of the parameter values being added
 * is the responsibility of the tag handler implementing this
 * interface</p>
 *
 * <p>The <code>SQLExcecutionTag</code> interface is exposed in order
 * to support custom parameter actions which may retrieve their
 * parameters from any source and process them before substituting
 * them for a parameter marker in the SQL statement of the
 * enclosing <code>SQLExecutionTag</code> action</p>
